### Nantsa Montillet (Xylobyte)
Hi, I have been passionate about programming for years and am currently training as a web developer!

I have knowledge in Android development, Web development and C++ programming with Qt. 
Currently I learn Rust programming language mainly for my project patcher.

If you have any project ideas or if you want to contribute to one of my projects, don't hesitate!

THANKS
