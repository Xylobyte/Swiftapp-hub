Hi 👋

My name is __Nantsa__, I currently work at __DREMML__ as an apprentice.
I have been passionate about electronics and programming since I was 9 years old, my first programming language, and still one of my favorites today with Rust, is C++.
I started my journey with Arduino, and I still really like embedded programming and robotics/home automation.

At the moment, I mainly do web development, but my real passion is performance and optimization, with languages ​​like C and Rust, and software and native app development.

If you have any project ideas or want to chat, I'm available 😁

Don't hesitate to contact me

Have fun!
